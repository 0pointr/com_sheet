Com_Sheet is a command line spreadsheet application which works by issuing

To compile, run : make
            Or,   make debug  to create a debug build

Here's a listing of the supported operations and their corresponding commands.
You can also access this help during program run time by issuing "help".

Working with com_sheet ::

Run with : <path_to_executable>/com_sheet
You'll generally issue a ire/irb if there's no spreadsheet already.
It will ask for initial number of columns, their names and then input for the first row.
Add more rows with ire or irb or ira as needed.
Add columns with ica. Other commands work as listed. Save the sheet with wrp or wrt if/as needed.
You can also begin by loading a saved com_sheet parsable file form disk with rdf, and do your stuff
on the loaded spreadsheet.
