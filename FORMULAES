Formulaes are algebric expressions that can have as variables the label names that contain neumeric values and allowed operators.

Allowed operators::
'(', ')', '^' , '*', '/', '+', and '-'

For example:: for the following table :

name doll cent
bob  57   32  
far  77   98  

A valid expression for label four (say, "total") woud be: doll+(cent/100).

or, anything as long as it contains nothing else than names of existing labels and the allowed set of operators.

Mathematically invalid expressions like 
*doll++cent
doll+(cent/100
(doll+cent))

will not be evaluated and an appriopriate error message will be shown.

As of com_sheet v0.4 beta, formulae columns can be added only as the last column in the current table.
i.e. you can't insert a formulae column anywhere except as the last column.
Although, more columns can be added after that.

Formulaes can't be edited after once the column has been created.
But data in formulae fields can be edited, but a warning is shown.

Each time a new row is added, the contents of fx column(s) (if any) for that corresponding row will be automatically generated.
